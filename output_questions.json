When Viru used to get out looking to hit another delivery out of the park, there used to be consternation around the ground, just like it is when Rohit gets out to a seemingly casual shot. If Rohit can turn his white ball exploits into red ball cricket, he will be the most destructive batsman in the world after Viv Richards and Virender Sehwag.\nWhile Sharma is not a regular bowler, he can bowl right-arm off spin.[9] He usually fields in the slips and has said this is a part of his game which he works very hard on for improvement.[116]"

        "answer": "The standout performer in both the limited overs series and the T20 series has been Rohit Sharma. Like Virender Sehwag before him, he is unstoppable once he gets going and like Viru he has an appetite for big hundreds. When Viru used to get out looking to hit another delivery out of the park, there used to be consternation around the ground, just like it is when Rohit gets out to a seemingly casual shot. If Rohit can turn his white ball exploits into red ball cricket, he will be the most destructive batsman in the world after Viv Richards and Virender Sehwag.\nWhile Sharma is not a regular bowler, he can bowl right-arm off spin.[9] He usually fields in the slips and has said this is a part of his game which he works very hard on for improvement.[116]"
